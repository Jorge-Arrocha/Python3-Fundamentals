    "Classes can “inherit” methods and class variables from other classes. We’ll see the mechanics of how this works in subsequent sections. First, however, let’s motivate why this might be valuable. It turns out that inheritance doesn’t let you do anything that you couldn’t do without it, but it makes some things a lot more elegant. You will also find it’s useful when someone else has defined a class in a module or library, and you just want to override a few things without having to reimplement everything they’ve done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our Tamagotchi game. Suppose we wanted to make some different kinds of pets that have the same structure as other pets, but have some different attributes or behave a little differently. For example, suppose that dog pets should show their emotional state a little differently than cats or act differently when they are hungry or when they are asked to fetch something.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could implement this by making an instance variable for the pet type and dispatching on that instance variable in various methods."

In the abstract, this is pretty intuitive: all pets have certain things, but dogs are different from cats, which are different from birds. Going a step further, a Collie dog is different from a Labrador dog, for example. Inheritance provides us with an easy and elegant way to represent these differences.\n",

    "2. Now, modify the code to define a new class, <font color=red>Tiger</font>. The <font color=red>Tiger</font> class should inherit from the <font color=red>Cat</font> class, but its default meow count should be <font color=red>5</font>, not <font color=red>3</font>, and it should have an extra instance method, <font color=red>roar</font>, that prints out the string <font color=red>ROOOOOAR!</font>.\n",
    "3. Next, modify the code so that when the <font color=red>hi</font> method is called for the <font color=red>Tiger</font> class, the <font color=red>roar</font> method is called. HINT: You’ll have to call one instance method inside another, and you’ll have to redefine a method for the <font color=red>Tiger</font> class. See the  \n",

It should be exactly like <font color=red>Lab</font>, except instead of printing just <font color=red>I found the tennis ball!</font> when the <font color=red>fetch</font> method is called, it should say <font color=red>I found the tennis ball! I can fetch anything!</font>. \n",
    "5. Add your own new pets and modifications as you like – remember, to use them in the game, you’ll also have to alter the <font color=red>whichtype</font> function so they can be used in game play. Otherwise, you’ll have different classes that may work just fine, but you won’t see the effects in the game, since the code that actually makes the game play is found in the second half of the provided code (look for the <font color=red>while</font> loop!)."
