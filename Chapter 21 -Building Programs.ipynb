    "Building on lessons learned in the first debugging interlude, this chapter offers a strategy for writing a program to solve a problem such as those that appear in the exercises at the ends of the chapters in this book. (A similar approach is helpful for writing larger programs, but that will come later.)\n",

    "You may find it tempting to start an exercise by copying and pasting a snippet of code from somewhere in the textbook, and hoping that a small edit will lead to a solution to the current problem. Often this will lead to frustration and confusion; after trying a few code substitutions that feel vaguely familiar to you, you‚Äôll find the code looking kind of complicated and the outputs baffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copying and editing snippets of code is actually a useful element of the strategy we outline below. But it comes a little later in the process, not as the first thing. And it requires a fair bit of work to make sure you understand the code snippet that you‚Äôve copied. Only then will you be able to find the *right* small edits to the code snippet to make it do what you want.</div>\n",

We are going to show you how to outline using comments, but if you are more visual you might want to sketch on a piece of paper and if you are more spatial try walking around the room. The big trick is to understand everything you want to do first in your own words, so then you are translating them to the computer.\n",
