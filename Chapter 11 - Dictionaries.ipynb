    "The compound data types we have studied in detail so far ‚Äî strings and lists ‚Äî are sequential collections. This means that the items in the collection are ordered from left to right and they use integers as indices to access the values they contain. This also means that looking for a particular value requires scanning the many items in the list until you find the desired value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can sometimes be organized more usefully by associating a key with the value we are looking for. For example, if you are asked for the page number for the start of chapter 5 in a large textbook, you might flip around the book looking for the chapter 5 heading. If the chapter number appears in the header or footer of each page, you might be able to find the page number fairly quickly but it‚Äôs generally easier and faster to go to the index page and see that chapter 5 starts on page 78.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of direct look up of a value in Python is done with an object called a Dictionary. Dictionaries are a different kind of collection. They are Python‚Äôs built-in mapping type. A map is an unordered, associative collection. The association, or mapping, is from a key, which can be of any immutable type (e.g., the chapter name and number in the analogy above), to a value (the starting page number), which can be any Python data object. You‚Äôll learn how to use these collections in the following chapter.\n",

You could try to keep track mentally that the zip code property is at index 2 in a list, but your code will be easier to read and you will make fewer mistakes if you can look up mydiction[‚Äòzipcode‚Äô] than if you look up mylst[2].\n",
    "- When you have a collection of data pairs, and you will often have to look up one of the pairs based on its first value, it is better to use a dictionary than a list of (key, value) tuples. With a dictionary, you can find the value for any (key, value) tuple by looking up the key. With a list of tuples you would need to iterate through the list, examining each pair to see if it had the key that you want.\n",
