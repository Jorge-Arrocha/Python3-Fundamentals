    "The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python. At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you mean for them to do. Thus, understanding computer code involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you wish would happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills.\n",

    "As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also __low-level languages__, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are __portable__, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: __interpreters__ and __compilers__. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.\n",

Modify the second print statement by changing the addition symbol, the <font color=red>+</font>, to the multiplication symbol, <font color=red>*</font>. Press *Save & Run* again to see the new results.\n",

    "As the name suggests, *Save & Run* also saves your latest version of the code, and you can recover it even in later sessions when *logged in*. If *not* logged in, *Run* saves versions *only until your browser leaves the current web page*, and then you lose all modifications.\n",

If you click on the slider location box, you can use your left and right arrow buttons to switch to other versions you ran. Alternately you can drag the box on the slider. Now move the slider to see a previously saved version of your code. You can edit or run any version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to activecode, you can also execute Python code with the assistance of a unique visualization tool. This tool, known as __codelens__, allows you to control the step by step execution of a program. It also lets you see the values of all variables as they are created and modified. In activecode, the source code executes from beginning to end and you can see the final result. In codelens you can see and control the step by step progress. Note that the red arrow always points to the next line of code that is going to be executed. The light green arrow points to the line that was just executed.

    "## 1.6. Formal and Natural Languages\n",
    "[Back to top](#Top)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Natural languages__ are the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Formal languages__ are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, <font color=red>3+3=6</font> is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but <font color=red>3=+6\\$</font> is not. $H_{2}O$ is a syntactically correct chemical name, but $_{2}Zz$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to __tokens__ and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with <font color=red>3=+6\\$</font> is that <font color=red>\\$</font> is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, $_{2}Zz$ is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation <font color=red>$Zz$</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of syntax rule pertains to the __structure__ of a statement‚Äî that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement <font color=red>3=+6$</font> is structurally illegal because you can‚Äôt place a plus sign immediately after an equal sign. Similarly, molecular formulas have to have subscripts after the element name, not before.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called __parsing__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you hear the sentence, ‚ÄúThe other shoe fell‚Äù, you understand that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the __semantics__ of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although formal and natural languages have many features in common ‚Äî tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics ‚Äî there are many differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "__ambiguity__  \n",
    "Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "__redundancy__  \n",
    "In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "__literalness__  \n",
    "Formal languages mean exactly what they say. On the other hand, natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, ‚ÄúThe other shoe fell‚Äù, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n",
    "    <font color=black><b>Tip</b><br>\n",
    "You‚Äôll need to find the original joke to understand the idiomatic meaning of the other shoe falling. Yahoo! Answers thinks it knows!</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "People who grow up speaking a natural language‚Äîthat is, everyone‚Äîoften have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between natural and formal language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\n",
    "\n",
    "__poetry__  \n",
    "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__prose__  \n",
    "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "__program__  \n",
    "The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Little things like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
