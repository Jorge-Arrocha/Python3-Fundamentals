    "## 18.1. Introduction: Test Cases\n",
    "A __test case__ expresses requirements for a program, in a way that can be checked automatically. Specifically, a test asserts something about the state of the program at a particular point in its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously suggested that it‚Äôs a good idea to first write down comments about what your code is supposed to do, before actually writing the code. It is an even better idea to write down some test cases before writing a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why it‚Äôs a good habit to write test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before we write code, we have in mind what it *should* do, but those thoughts may be a little vague. Writing down test cases forces us to be more concrete about what should happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we write the code, the test cases can provide automated feedback. You‚Äôve actually been the beneficiary of such automated feedback via test cases throughout this book in some of the activecode windows and almost all of the exercises. We wrote the code for those test cases but kept it hidden, so as not to confuse you and also to avoid giving away the answers. You can get some of the same benefit from writing your own test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In larger software projects, the set of test cases can be run every time a change is made to the code base. __Unit tests__ check that small bits of code are correctly implemented. __Functional tests__ check that larger chunks of code work correctly. Running the tests can help to identify situations where a change in code in one place breaks the correct operation of some other code. We won‚Äôt see that advantage of test cases in this textbook, but keep in mind that this introduction to test cases is setting the stage for an essential software engineering practice if you are participating in a larger software development project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it‚Äôs time to learn how to write code for test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a statement called <font color=red>assert</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Following the word assert there will be a python expression.\n",
    "- If that expression evaluates to the Boolean <font color=red>False</font>, then the interpreter will raise a runtime error.\n",
    "- If the expression evaluates to <font color=red>True</font>, then nothing happens and the execution goes on to the next line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you ever want to write a line of code that can never compute anything useful for you, but sometimes causes a runtime error? For all the reasons we described above about the value of automated tests. You want a test that will alert that you that some condition you assumed was true is not in fact true. It‚Äôs much better to be alerted to that fact right away than to have some unexpected result much later in your program execution, which you will have trouble tracing to the place where you had an error in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why doesn‚Äôt <font color=red>assert</font> print out something saying that the test passed? The reason is that you don‚Äôt want to clutter up your output window with the results of automated tests that pass. You just want to know when one of your tests fails. In larger projects, other testing harnesses are used instead of <font color=red>assert</font>, such as the python <font color=red>unittest</font> module. Those provide some output summarizing tests that have passed as well as those that failed. In this textbook, we will just use simple <font color=red>assert</font> statements for automated tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a test, we must know what we *expect* some value to be at a particular point in the program‚Äôs execution. In the rest of the chapter, we‚Äôll see some examples of <font color=red>assert</font> statements and ideas for what kinds of assertions one might want to add in one‚Äôs programs.\n",

    "[Back to top](#Top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some other programming languages, the python interpreter does not enforce restrictions about the data types of objects that can be bound to particular variables. For example, in java, before assigning a value to a variable, the program would include a declaration of what type of value (integer, float, Boolean, etc.) that the variable is allowed to hold. The variable <font color=red>x</font> in a python program can be bound to an integer at one point and to a list at some other point in the program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "That flexibility makes it easier to get started with programming in python. Sometimes, however, type checking could alert us that something has gone wrong in our program execution. If we are assuming at that <font color=red>x</font> is a list, but it‚Äôs actually an integer, then at some point later in the program execution, there will probably be an error. We can add assert<font color=red>text</font> statements that will cause an error to be flagged sooner rather than later, which might make it a lot easier to debug.\n",

    "### 18.6.1. Return Value Tests\n",
    "[Back to top](#Top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing whether a function returns the correct value is the easiest test case to define. You simply check whether the result of invoking the function on a particular input produces the particular output that you expect. If <font color=red>f</font> is your function, and you think that it should transform inputs <font color=red>x</font> and <font color=red>y</font> into output <font color=red>z</font>, then you could write a test as <font color=red>assert f(x, y) == z</font>. Or, to give a more concrete example, if you have a function <font color=red>square</font>, you could have a test case <font color=red>assert square(3) ==  9</font>. Call this a __return value test__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each test checks whether a function works properly on specific inputs, the test cases will never be complete: in principle, a function might work properly on all the inputs that are tested in the test cases, but still not work properly on some other inputs. That‚Äôs where the art of defining test cases comes in: you try to find specific inputs that are representative of all the important kinds of inputs that might ever be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test case that you define for a function should be an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù case, one that is prototypical of the kinds of inputs the function is supposed to handle. Additional test cases should handle ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or unusual inputs, sometimes called __edge cases__. For example, if you are defining the ‚Äúsquare‚Äù function, the first, easy case, might be an input like 3. Additional extreme or unusual inputs around which you create test cases might be a negative number, 0, and a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about how to generate edge cases is to think in terms of __equivalence classes__ of the different kinds of inputs the function might get. For example, the input to the <font color=red>square</font> function could be either positive or negative. We then choose an input from each of these classes. __It is important to have at least one test for each equivalence class of inputs__.\n",

    "Semantic errors are often caused by improperly handling the boundaries between equivalence classes. The boundary for this problem is zero. __It is important to have a test at each boundary__.\n",

For example, in the square function we might mistakenly use addition instead of multiplication. Thus, we shouldn‚Äôt rely on a test that uses 2 as input, but we might be fooled into thinking it was working when it produced an output of 4, when it was really doubling rather than squaring.\n",
