    "Programming is a complex process. Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur. Programming errors are called __bugs__ and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called __debugging__. Some claim that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one of the first computers at Harvard, and the term __bug__ has remained in use since. For more about this historic event, see [<font color=blue>first bug</font>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg).\n",

    "One of the most important skills you need to acquire to complete this book successfully is the ability to debug your programs. Debugging might be the most under-appreciated, and under-taught, skill in introductory computer science. For that reason we are introducing a series of ‚Äúdebugging interludes.‚Äù Debugging is a skill that you need to master over time, and some of the tips and tricks are specific to different aspects of Python programming. So look for additional Way of the Programmer interludes throughout the rest of this book.\n",

    "Programming is an odd thing in a way. Here is why. As programmers we spend 99% of our time trying to get our program to work. We struggle, we stress, we spend hours deep in frustration trying to get our program to execute correctly. Then when we do get it going we celebrate, hand it in, and move on to the next homework assignment or programming task. But here is the secret, when you are successful, you are happy, your brain releases a bit of chemical that makes you feel good. You need to organize your programming so that you have lots of little successess. It turns out your brain doesn‚Äôt care all that much if you have successfully written hello world, or a fast fourier transform (trust me its hard) you still get that little release that makes you happy. When you are happy you want to go on and solve the next little problem. Essentially I‚Äôm telling you once again, start small, get something small working, and then add to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='3.2.1'></a>\n",
    "### 3.2.1. How to Avoid Debugging\n",
    "[Back to top](#Top)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Perhaps the most important lesson in debugging is that it is __largely avoidable__ ‚Äì if you work carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Understand the Problem__ You must have a firm grasp on __what__ you are trying to accomplish but not necessarily how to do it. You do not need to understand the entire problem. But you must understand at least a portion of it and what the program should do in a specific circumstance ‚Äì what output should be produced for some given input. This will allow you to test your progress. You can then identify if a solution is correct or whether there remains work to do or bugs to fix. This is probably the single biggest piece of advice for programmers at every level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Start Small__ It is tempting to sit down and crank out an entire program at once. But, when the program ‚Äì inevitably ‚Äì does not work, you have a myriad of options for things that might be wrong. Where to start? Where to look first? How to figure out what went wrong? I‚Äôll get to that in the next section. So, start with something really small. Maybe just two lines and then make sure that runs. Hitting the run button is quick and easy. It gives you immediate feedback about whether what you have just done works or not. Another immediate benefit of having something small working is that you have something to turn in. Turning in a small, incomplete program, is almost always better than nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Keep Improving It__ Once you have a small part of your program working, the next step is to figure out something small to add to it ‚Äì how can you move closer to a correct solution. As you add to your program, you gain greater insight into the underlying problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much easier to figure out what went wrong. (This of course means you must be able to recognize if there is an error. And that is done through testing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  As long as you always test each new bit of code, it is most likely that any error is in the new code you have just added. Less new code means its easier to figure out where the problem is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of __Get something working and keep improving it__ is a mantra that you can repeat throughout your career as a programmer. It‚Äôs a great way to avoid the frustrations mentioned above. Think of it this way. Every time you have a little success, your brain releases a tiny bit of chemical that makes you happy. So, you can keep yourself happy and make programming more enjoyable by creating lots of small victories for yourself.\n",

But if you entered 17 (5pm) for the hours and 9 for the wait time then the result of 26 is not correct. This illustrates an important aspect of __testing__, which is that it is important to test your code on a range of inputs. It is especially important to test your code on __boundary conditions__. In this case you would want to test your program for hours including 0, 23, and some in between. You would want to test your wait times for 0, and some really large numbers.

    "Debugging a program is a different way of thinking than writing a program. The process of debugging is much more like being a detective. Here are a few rules to get you thinking about debugging.\n",

    "1. Everyone is a suspect (Except Python)! It‚Äôs common for beginner programmers to blame Python, but that should be your last resort. Remember that Python has been used to solve CS1 level problems millions of times by millions of other programmers. So, Python is probably not the problem.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check your assumptions. At this point in your career you are still developing your mental model of how Python does its work. Its natural to think that your code is correct, but with debugging you need to make your code the primary suspect. Even if you think it is right, you should verify that it really is by liberally using print statements to verify that the values of variables really are what you think they should be. You‚Äôll be surprised how often they are not.<br><br>\n",

    "For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit. You will not be able to complete the execution of your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors.

    "![error_dist.png](attachment:error_dist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 90% of the error messages encountered for this problem are SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError, ValueError, or AttributeError. We will look at these errors in three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we will define what these four error messages mean.\n",
    "- Then, we will look at some examples that cause these errors to occur.\n",
    "- Finally we will look at ways to help uncover the root cause of these messages.\n",

    "Syntax errors happen when you make an error in the syntax of your program. Syntax errors are like making grammatical errors in writing. If you don‚Äôt use periods and commas in your writing then you are making it hard for other readers to figure out what you are trying to say. Similarly Python has certain grammatical rules that must be followed or else Python can‚Äôt figure out what you are trying to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually SyntaxErrors can be traced back to missing punctuation characters, such as parentheses, quotation marks, or commas.

    "__Finding Clues__ One thing that can help you in this situation is to print out the values and the types of the variables involved in the statement that is causing the error. You might try adding a print statement after line 4 <font color=red>print(x, type(x))</font> You will see that at least we have confirmed that x is of type string. Now you need to start to work backward through the program. You need to ask yourself, where is x used in the program? x is used on lines 2, 3, and of course 5 and 6 (where we are getting an error). So maybe you move the print statement to be after line 2 and again after 3. Line 3 is where you expect the value of x to be changed to an integer. Could line 4 be mysteriously changing x back to a string? Not very likely. So the value and type of x is just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but not after line 3. This helps you isolate the problem to line 3. In fact if you employ one of our earlier techniques of commenting out line 3 you will see that this has no impact on the error, and is a big clue that line 3 as it is currently written is useless.\n",
